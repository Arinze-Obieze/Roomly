# Roomly Design Principles & Research
 
This document outlines the core design philosophies driving Roomly's interface, synthesizing global best practices with our specific "Vibe-First" mission.
 
## 1. Jobs To Be Done (JTBD) Framework
**Theory**: Users don't "buy products"; they "hire" them to make progress in their lives.
**Application to Roomly**:
- **The Job**: "Help me find a safe home where I feel I belong, quickly and without social anxiety."
- **Implication**:
    - **Outcome-Based Filters**: Don't just filter by "3 beds". Filter by "Student Friendly" or "Quiet House" (Lifestyle).
    - **Contextual Cards**: Show "Commute time to [User's Work]" on the listing card, not just "Dublin 4".
    - **Emotional Safety**: Show "Verified Host" and "Response Rate" prominently to reduce the fear of rejection or scams.
 
## 2. Jakob Nielsen’s 10 Usability Heuristics
**Theory**: Broad rule of thumb for human-computer interaction.
**Application to Roomly**:
- **Visibility of System Status**: Always show active filters. If a search yields 0 results, explain *why* (e.g., "No homes under €500 in D4") and offer a "Clear Filters" action.
- **Match Between System & Real World**: Use natural language. Instead of "Rent Period: Fixed", use "1 Year Lease". Instead of "Occupancy: 1", use "Private Room".
- **Consistency and Standards**: Ensure the "Contact" button is in the same place on every page. Use standard icons (Heart for save, Share for... share).
- **Aesthetic and Minimalist Design**: Remove "chartjunk". Only show the top 3 amenities on a card. Hide technical details (BER rating) behind a "Read More" unless critical.
 
## 3. Atomic Design (Brad Frost)
**Theory**: UI is a hierarchy: Atoms (Labels) -> Molecules (Form Fields) -> Organisms (Forms) -> Templates -> Pages.
**Application to Roomly**:
- **Atoms**: Our specialized "Terracotta" buttons, "Navy" headings, and "Pill" tags.
- **Molecules**: The `ListingCard` is a molecule made of an Image atom, a Price atom, and a Badge atom.
- **Organisms**: The `PropertyGrid` and `FilterModal` are organisms.
- **Strategy**: We must build a `ListingCard` that is robust enough to start simple (Image + Price) and expand (add Match Score, Commute) without breaking the layout.
 
## 4. Material Design (Google) - Motion & Depth
**Theory**: Use shadows and movement to imply physical surfaces and hierarchy.
**Application to Roomly**:
- **Elevation**: Listing cards should lift (`hover:-translate-y-1`, `shadow-lg`) on interactions to invite clicking.
- **Motion**: Transitions between "Grid View" and "Map View" should be fluid, not instant cuts.
- **Touch Targets**: Mobile filters must be at least 48x48px (fingertip size). The "Contact" button must be the easiest element to tap on mobile.
 
## 5. Apple Human Interface Guidelines (HIG) - Clarity & Deference
**Theory**: Content is king. The UI should recede.
**Application to Roomly**:
- **Deference**: The UI chrome (headers, footers) should use `bg-white/80 backdrop-blur` to let the listing images shine through.
- **Legibility**: Use San Francisco-style font stacks (Inter/Roboto). High contrast text (`Slate-900`) on white backgrounds.
- **Navigation**: Bottom tabs for Mobile (Search, Saved, Messages, Profile) are superior to Hamburger menus for core navigation.

## 🚀 Strategic Recommendations for Dashboard Redesign
 
### A. The "Smart" Listing Card
Current cards are static. They should be dynamic based on the user.
- **Match Score**: "87% Match" badge (Calculated from User Preferences vs. Property Tags).
- **Social Proof**: "3 of your friends liked similar homes".
- **Scannability**: Use icons for "Pet Friendly" or "Ensuite" instead of text lists.
 
### B. Intelligent Filtering (The "Vibe" Filter)
Standard filters (Price, Beds) are table stakes. formatting.
- **Lifestyle Filters**: "LGBTQ+ Friendly", "Gamers", "Vegetarian House".
- **Commute Filter**: "Max 30 mins to [Work Location]".
- **Deal Breakers**: Explicitly exclude "Smokers" or "No Pets".
 
### C. Layout & Placement
- **Sticky Filters**: On Desktop, filters should be a sticky sidebar or a persistent top bar, not a modal that hides context.
- **Split View**: Offer a toggle between "List", "Grid", and "Split Map" (List on left, Map on right) for spatial context.
- **Zero States**: When a search fails, suggest "Similar homes in nearby neighborhoods".
