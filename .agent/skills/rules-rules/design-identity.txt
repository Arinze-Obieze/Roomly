2. Design Language
A. Shapes & Corner Radius
RoomFind is friendly, not corporate. We avoid sharp edges.

Radii:

Heavy use of 24px for cards

40px for hero elements

12px for buttons

Rule: If it's a content container, round the corners significantly.

B. Depth & Effects
Glassomorphism: Subtle use of backdrop-filter with white opacity to create depth, especially on colored backgrounds.

Shadows: Soft, diffused shadows with low opacity. Avoid harsh, black drop shadows. Use colored shadows (e.g., coral tint) for a premium feel.

Gradients: Subtle gradients (e.g., Terracotta 500 to 600) to add dimension to flat colors.

C. Iconography
Style: Rounded, Filled, or Thick Stroke (2px+)

Container: Icons often live inside containers with pastel backgrounds (e.g., Teal icon on Teal-50 background)

Library: Material Design Rounded is the current standard
